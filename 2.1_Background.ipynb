    "We choose air quality as our reasearch topic,but what do we want to know and what kind of problems we want to solve is our main thinking direction.We googled some news on air quality and know the air pollution is a constant issue in whole world. We found World major city air quality ranking in https://www.iqair.com/world-air-quality-ranking. Due to the richness of data and convenience of language, WE decided to choose Pland as our study area. After googled the news of air pollution in Poland these years, WE want to investigate what caused the bad air quality in Poland and the impacts of it. Then the problem is choose the time range we want to research, After listing the possible influences of air quality and searched the datasets , we found the time availablity is different in every datasets. \n"

For the machine learning , I know a little about this which means I only know the existence of some name fo model,After doing the project ,I know how to use Python to train decision trees and tree-based models with the user-friendly scikit-learn machine learning library.For the data quality, I know how to look at our data through a more critical lens and think about potential data quality issues before using it."
