    "I’m from MGI, I learned some basic knowledge of geo-spatial analysis with python and R ,but currently I'm only at the beginner level which means I only know some easy usage of script to do data preprocess, analysis. And I have very limited experience on Machine Learning. I only construced Random Forest model in R to indentify the pateches in raster. I cooperated with classmates to do geoscripting project before without thinking about the quality of datat because the data is provided by our supervisor.\\\n",

    "I expect to learn more about geospatial analysis, know more about Machine learning models to conduct data analysis, and think more about data quality after getting out of this course."
