# Individual_Portfolio _Smart_Environments
- **The background**
  I'm always interested in how to use knowledge of science to solve some realistic problems,considering data science courses requirement and my own interest, I set three goals for myself to have fun in this courses with my groupmates. We are formed in one group because we have similar interested topics.\
  We choose air quality as our reasearch topic,but what do we want to know and what kind of problems we want to solve is our main thinking direction.We googled some news on air quality and know the air pollution is a constant issue in whole world. We found World major city air quality ranking in https://www.iqair.com/world-air-quality-ranking.
  My goals are learning more about geospatial analysis, knowing more about Machine learning models to conduct data analysis, and thinking more about data quality after getting out of this course.\
  Although I've already practice with some geospatial analysis before, I had to admit I'm not expertise in this, After doing the project, I know more about 
- **Methodology and data source used**
  
- **Details about the implementation**
  
- **Results**
  
- **Conclusions both on the results as well as on the accomplishment of the goal**
